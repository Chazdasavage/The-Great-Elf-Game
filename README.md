This is a simple implementation of the Great Elf Game which I played several times in school.

There is little documentation on the game so this serves to be a recreation of it.

You can find several versions by searching the game's name however I am unaware who the original creator is, all credits to them.

I have taken some liberties and made a few tweaks, largely making it faster and more random.

In order to play this for yourself there are 2 methods.

1. Run the executable file itself however this targets the .NET Framework Version 4.8, so you would need a platform that allows you to run .NET applications of this version.
2. Copy the code into any console/platform capable of running a C# program and it should work just fine.

This game was initially designed as a fun Christmas-themed game to help children improve their mathematics skills.
The general idea is that you send working elves to various locations to harvest trees whilst you make decisions in the face of various random events.

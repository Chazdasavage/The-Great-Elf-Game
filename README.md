This is a simple implementation of the Great Elf Game which I played several times in school.

There is little documentation on the game so this serves to be a recreation of it.

I have taken some liberties and made a few tweaks, largely making it faster and more random.

In order to play this for yourself, all that you need to do is copy the code into any console capable of running C#.
